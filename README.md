# Music_Genre_Classification
A music genre classifier is a software program that predicts the genre of a piece of music in audio format. These systems are used for tasks such as automatically tagging music for distributors like Spotify and Billboard, as well as determining appropriate background music for events.

Currently, genre classification is performed manually by humans applying their personal understanding of music. This task has not yet been automated by conventional algorithmic approaches since the distinctions between music genres are relatively subjective and ill-defined. However, the ambiguity of genre classification makes machine intelligence well-suited to this task. Given enough audio data, which can be easily harvested from freely available music online, machine learning can observe and make predictions using these subtle patterns.

The goal of this project is to build a proof-of-concept music genre classifier using a deep learning approach. This classifier should be able to correctly predict the genre and confidence level of Western music from four candidate genres: classical, jazz, rap, and rock.
