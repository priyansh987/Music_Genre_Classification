# Music_Genre_Classification
Predict te genre of te song entered by user. Based on CNN classfication,deep learning concept.
A music genre classifier is a software program that predicts the genre of a piece
of music in audio format. These devices are used for tasks such as automatically
tagging music for distributors such as Spotify and Billboard and determining appropriate
background music for events.
Currently, genre classification is performed manually by humans applying their
personal understanding of music. This task has not yet been automated by conventional
algorithmic approaches since the distinctions between music genres are relatively
subjective and ill-defined. However, the ambiguity of genre classification makes
machine intelligence well-suited to this task. Given enough audio data, of which large
amounts can be easily harvested from freely available music online, machine learning
can observe and make predictions using these ill-defined patterns.
The goal of this project is to build a proof-of-concept music genre classifier using
a deep learning approach that can correctly predict the genre and confidence level of
Western music from four candidate genres (classical, jazz, rap, rock).
